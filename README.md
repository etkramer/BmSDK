**Only the Epic Games Store version of the game is supported.**

Support for the Steam version is planned for the near future.

## üìñ About
BmSDK is a C#-based scripting system for Batman: Arkham City, allowing mods to add custom gameplay and logic to the game. Check out the [wiki](../../wiki) for more info.

## üöÄ Getting started (for users)
If you're a user (meaning you just want to run script mods, not make them), getting started is simple:
1. Go to [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and install the .NET 8 SDK if you haven't already.
2. Download the latest release from [releases](../../releases/latest) and open the .zip file.
3. Inside you'll see two folders: `Binaries` and `BmGame`. Copy both to your game folder (likely `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\BatmanArkhamCity`). There should already be 2 folders in there with the same names.
4. Done, BmSDK is installed! Now to install script mods, simply drop any .cs files into your `BmGame\Scripts` folder.

Keep in mind that script mods can potentially harm your computer. Make sure you only download and install scripts from trusted sources.
