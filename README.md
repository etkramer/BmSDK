## 📖 About
BmSDK is a C#-based scripting system for Batman: Arkham City, allowing mods to add custom gameplay and logic to the game. Check out the [wiki](../../wiki) for more info.

Currently only the EGS version of the game is supported, though extending support to the Steam version is planned.

## 🚀 Getting started (users)
If you're a user (meaning you just want to run script mods, not make them), getting started is simple:
1. Download the latest release from [releases](../../releases/latest) and open the .zip file.
2. Inside you'll see two folders: `Binaries` and `BmGame`. Copy both to your game folder (likely `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\BatmanArkhamCity`). There should already be 2 folders in there with the same names.
3. Done, BmSDK is installed! Now to install script mods, simply drop any .cs files into your `BmGame\Scripts` folder.

Keep in mind that script mods can potentially harm your computer. Make sure you only download and install scripts from trusted sources.
