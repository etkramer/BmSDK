## 📖 About
BmSDK is a C#-based scripting system for Batman: Arkham City, allowing mods to add custom logic and behavior to the game. Currently only the EGS version of the game is supported, though extending support to the Steam version is planned. Support for Knight is not planned.

## 🚀 Getting started (for users)
If you're a user (meaning you just want to run script mods, not make them), installation is simple:
1. Download the latest release from [Releases](/releases/latest) and open the .zip.
2. Inside you'll see two folders - 'Binaries' and 'BmGame'. Copy both into your game directory (likely `C:\Games\BatmanArkhamCity`), where you should already have 2 folders with the same names.
3. Done, BmSDK is installed! Now to install script mods, simply drop any .cs files into your `BmGame\Scripts` folder

Keep in mind that script mods can potentially harm your computer. Make sure you only download and install scripts from trusted sources.
